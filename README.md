## Build Setup

##### Note that currently, the only supported development environment is OSX, Windows and linux are work in progress.

Grab the latest `mysterium_client` binary for OSX from https://github.com/MysteriumNetwork/node/releases and put it into your project's `bin` directory (make sure to rename it to `mysterium_client`)

Install `openvpn` from https://openvpn.net/ or for OSX with homebrew run `brew install openvpn`

Once `openvpn` is installed you need to symlink it to your project's directory:

##### Note: If installed via brew you can get the installation path using `brew info openvpn`, the binary should be in `<install dir>/sbin/openvpn`

```bash
ln -s <path to openvpn binary> <full path to project dir>/bin/openvpn
```

Download `update-resolv-conf` and `GeoLite2-Country.mmdb` from https://github.com/MysteriumNetwork/node/tree/master/bin/client_package/config and paste it into your project's `bin/config` directory.

Install `yarn` from https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/

Once you're all set, cd into your project's root directory.

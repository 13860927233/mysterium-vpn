<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Please read the guidelines below and accept these Terms and Conditions to join the Mysterium Node Runner Pilot. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mysterium Node Runner </span><strong>(the &ldquo;Pilot&rdquo;) </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">description </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This pilot is an internal test that we are running over the period of one month with the purpose of gathering data on our network, users and incentive structures. It consists of onboarding both node runners and traffic providers on the Mysterium Network and analysing a set of performance metrics. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will gradually onboard a certain number of nodes who have been pre-screened through a questionnaire, and we will give them minimum performance requirements. We will simultaneously push traffic through these nodes to analyse node behavior and overall network health. If the minimum requirements are met, the nodes will receive compensation for participating. We will be monitoring their bandwidth performance to ensure that they are meeting our requirements and should they fall outside of the given metrics, they will not receive compensation. In order to incentivize better participation in the pilot, we will have a leaderboard where we will track the top 10 performers. These &lsquo;leaders&rsquo; will receive extra benefits during each payment cycle. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the length of the pilot, we reserve the right to make any changes to the metrics we follow in order to assess the network in a manner that we see fit. We will inform you as soon as any changes are made to the node runner requirements so you can adjust accordingly. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the one month pilot, we will assess overall performance and will decide on next steps. We cannot ensure that all or any of the participating nodes in the pilot will continue to be used in our network once the Pilot ends. Below you will find the general terms and conditions that you will have to accept in order to continue with the pilot. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Pilot Terms </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please note that your participation in the Pilot is voluntary and subject to the terms and conditions set forth on this page (the &ldquo;</span><strong>Pilot Terms</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rdquo;). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By participating in the Pilot you are fully accepting the terms, conditions and disclaimers contained in this document and all policies and guidelines that are incorporated by reference. If you do not accept these terms and conditions you must immediately stop participating in the Pilot and stop running a Mysterium service (docker/app/CLI) which serves as a vehicle to share bandwidth during the duration of the Pilot. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eligibility Requirements </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be eligible for the Pilot, please:</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
  <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fill in the Pilot questionnaire and provide us with an email address where we can contact you should anything go wrong with your payment. Failure to do so will result in our inability to pay you once we start the program if we can&rsquo;t reach you. </span></li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> be able to download and install node runner software. Although we offer discretionary support, we are not responsible for any issues with your installation during the Pilot. </span></li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have an Ethereum Wallet address where we can make the payments. </span></li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> comply with node runner software terms &amp; conditions at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://mysterium.network/terms-conditions/ </span></li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> not be employed or associated with NetSys Inc. or any its affiliates. </span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Payments </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All payments for top nodes will be made in ETH (Ethereum). You will be responsible for any tax implications related to the payments you receive, as determined by the laws of your jurisdiction of residence or citizenship. Local laws may require us to ask for proof of identity. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will need to register your ETH Wallet address when you install the node runner software. Payments will be made to this wallet address only. Should you make any mistakes in giving us your wallet address we will be unable to pay you for your service. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Payments will be made on a weekly basis. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will pay $10 worth of ETH per week for sharing your bandwidth during the Pilot. Here are the </span><strong>minimum requirements </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">to continue to get paid on a weekly basis. Anyone who falls under these standards will not receive payment in the following cycle. </span><strong>Attention: </strong><strong>Shutdown and sleep mode will not be able to share. Your operating system has to be active and running the required software and have an active Internet connection. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Sharing 1 GB of bandwidth over the course of the week</span><br />
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">2. 10 unique sessions during the week </span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to receive an additional $10 worth of ETH per week, you will need to become a top 10 performer on our leaderboard. The conditions for being in the top 10 are as follows:&nbsp; <br /><br />1.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Minimum </span><strong>5 GB </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">of data transferred <br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Minimum of </span><strong>10 h </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">availability per week </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The leaderboard can be found at testnet.mysterium.network. This is a way for us to track the top 10 performers in the network based on the criteria above. The more data you share and the more hours you keep your connection running per week, the higher are your chances to become a top 10 node and earn extra compensation. The compensation is capped at $10 worth of ETH per week for each top 10 nodes. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will also be looking at the following metrics to improve the user experience for nodes but this will not affect how much you can earn:<br /></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. Successful vs unsuccessful connections&nbsp;<br /><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Number of unique sessions during the week </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. The average duration of each session </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">These conditions may change throughout the Pilot and we will inform you as soon as we implement new ones. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each Sunday at 23:59 EST we will announce the top 10 nodes according to the leaderboard and process payments the following week. This process will be repeated every Sunday throughout the Pilot. The announcement will happen on our Telegram group Mysterium_Network_Nodes. You can always track the leaderboard at the following link: testnet.mysterium.network. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Pilot is set to run for one month starting on March 18th and will end on April 14th. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are disqualified from the Program for any reason, you will NOT receive any payments. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additional bounties may be earned throughout the Pilot and we will announce them on a rolling basis. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Changes to Program Terms </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Program Terms, including its terms, policies, conditions and disclaimers are subject to change or cancellation by us at any time, without any additional notice. As such, we may amend these Terms and/or its policies at any time. By continuing to participate in the Program after we post any such changes, you accept the Program Terms, as modified. </span></p>
